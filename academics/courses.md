# Useful UIUC Classes

This page lists some classes our group has found useful.

## NPRE

### Reactor Kinetics and Dynamics (NPRE 560)

This class presents historical approaches to fission reactor kinetics and dynamics, where the lectures and homeworks follow Introductory Nuclear Reactor Dynamics (Ott and Neuhold) and Dynamics of Nuclear Reactors (Hetrick) to the letter. Most of the methods discussed in the course have been antiquated by advances in computing over the last 30-40 years, however the intuition provided by these discussions may prove valuable to someone who is unfamiliar with the time behavior of fission reactors. The computer projects are the most useful components of the class to all students as they can be taylored to one's individual research interests. They consist of implementing various methods for point reactor kinetics (CP1), point reactor dynamics with feedback (CP2), and a kinetics/dynamics project of the student's choice (CP3).

## CS

### CS 555 (also goes by CSE 510 / MATH 552)

This class introduces varies numerical methods for solving both hyperbolic and elliptic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). The first month is spent on finite difference methods to introduce the class to various numerical principles (stability, consistency, convergence, dispersion, dissipation, etc.), which is followed by a few weeks on finite volume methods (for hyperbolic problems), and a few weeks on finite element methods (for elliptic problems). The remainder of the course functions as a special topics class in numerical methods and depends on the interests of the students / whims of the professor. The course strikes a nice balance in introducing the theoretical underpinnings of numerical methods for PDEs while also providing opportunities to implement the methods on the four homeworks / on the final project. The class assumes a background which includes senior undergraduate numerics classes, and so some of the lectures may be difficult to follow if the student doesn't have said background. Overall, the course is worth taking if you want to gain a better understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of PDE numerics without taking a pure math class.

# Non-Useful UIUC Classes

## NPRE 

### Probabilistic Risk Assessment (NPRE 461)

Theories and techniques of risk, safety, and reliability of complex systems and Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA), which provides input for risk-informed decision-making for design, operation, and regulatory oversight. Topics include: Systematic Risk Scenario Modeling, Consequence Analysis, Bayesian Updating, Bayesian Belief Network, Binary Decision Diagram, Uncertainty Propagation, Hardware Reliability, Human Error Modeling, Failure Causal Modeling, Maintenance and Repair Modeling, Risk Importance Ranking, and Data Analytics. The course material sacrifices depth for breadth, the software discussed is outdated, and the amount (not the difficulty) of the assignments is excessive. This is very much a busywork class. NPRE 461 one of the rare classes with an online section, which is valuable for some learners, but this should not be the first choice for in-person students in the M&M lab.
