# UIUC Classes

This page lists some classes our group has found useful.

## NPRE

### Reactor Kinetics and Dynamics (NPRE 560)

This class presents historical approaches to fission reactor kinetics and dynamics, where the lectures and homeworks follow Introductory Nuclear Reactor Dynamics (Ott and Neuhold) and Dynamics of Nuclear Reactors (Hetrick) to the letter. Most of the methods discussed in the course have been antiquated by advances in computing over the last 30-40 years, however the intuition provided by these discussions may prove valuable to someone who is unfamiliar with the time behavior of fission reactors. The computer projects are the most useful components of the class to all students as they can be taylored to one's individual research interests. They consist of implementing various methods for point reactor kinetics (CP1), point reactor dynamics with feedback (CP2), and a kinetics/dynamics project of the student's choice (CP3).

## CS

### Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations  (CS 555 / CSE 510 / MATH 552)

This class introduces varies numerical methods for solving both hyperbolic and elliptic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). The first month is spent on finite difference methods to introduce the class to various numerical principles (stability, consistency, convergence, dispersion, dissipation, etc.), which is followed by a few weeks on finite volume methods (for hyperbolic problems), and a few weeks on finite element methods (for elliptic problems). The remainder of the course functions as a special topics class in numerical methods and depends on the interests of the students / whims of the professor. The course strikes a nice balance in introducing the theoretical underpinnings of numerical methods for PDEs while also providing opportunities to implement the methods on the four homeworks / on the final project. The class assumes a background which includes senior undergraduate numerics classes, and so some of the lectures may be difficult to follow if the student doesn't have said background. Overall, the course is worth taking if you want to gain a better understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of PDE numerics without taking a pure math class.

## ATMS

### Numerical Fluid Dynamics (ATMS 502 / CSE 566)

This class focuses on solving fluid flow problems numerically while developing skills in programming and data visualization. No prior background in atmospheric sciences is required. Topics of stability, error types, and their quantification are studied. Students will learn and apply finite difference and finite volume methods by implementing them in code for various homework assignments. The course takes a gradual approach, beginning with a simple 1D advection problem and progressively advancing to 2D and 3D cases, including the use of both regular and nested grids, with students writing the code for grid nesting as well. A key goal of the course is to help students design their code for efficient execution on parallel computers. Prof. Jewett is a great teacher and runs the class very well. The amount of time you will spend on assignments will vary based on how proficient you are with programming. However, the professor is willing to help and debug your code with you, which is super helpful.
